# Copycat CNN

Here you can find the models, the datasets information and the code used in our experiments ([Copycat](README.md#1-stealing-knowledge-by-persuading-confession-with-random-non-labeled-data) and [Copycat Expansion](README.md#2-copycat-cnn-are-random-non-labeled-data-enough-to-steal-knowledge-from-black-box-models)).
Feel free to contact me for any questions or suggestions (jacsonrcsilva at gmail).

Note that we used the Caffe Framework ([1](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), [2](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:caffe)).
Therefore, you will find the "prototxt" files to replicate our experiments.

But if you don't want to use Caffe, it is not a problem.
In order to make it easier for you, we are also providing the following codes implemented in **PyTorch**:
* [Copycat Example](Example_of_use); and
* [Copycat Framework](https://github.com/jeiks/copycat_framework) to you apply/test Copycat Method against your own data.

Also, if you want to see an interactive comparison between Oracle and Copycat models, visit: [Copycat CNN Explainer](http://www.jeiks.net/copycat-cnn-explainer/)
<br>It is implemented in TensorflowJS, using the [CNN Explainer](https://github.com/poloclub/cnn-explainer) system.
