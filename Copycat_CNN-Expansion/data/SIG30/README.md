<hr>
To generate the SIG dataset, you have to run the scripts in [dataset_creation](./dataset_creation/).<br>
But, before generate the SIG dataset, you must download the TT100K and TSRD datasets.

Then, [download](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html) the following files:

* TSRD-Test.zip;
* tsrd-train.zip;

And [download](http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/traffic-sign/) the following file:

* data.zip
